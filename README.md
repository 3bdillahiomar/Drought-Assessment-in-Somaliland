# üåæüõ∞Ô∏è Spatiotemporal Analysis of Agricultural Drought Severity and Hotspots in Somaliland üåßÔ∏èüìâ

This repository hosts the preprint paper titled "Spatiotemporal Analysis of Agricultural Drought Severity and Hotspots in Somaliland." The study provides a comprehensive analysis of agricultural droughts in Somaliland, utilizing spatiotemporal data. It integrates MODIS-derived vegetation indices and CHIRPS precipitation data to identify and assess drought severity and hotspots over time.

The repository contains the data, code, and results from the study, offering valuable resources for further research and practical applications in drought monitoring and mitigation.
